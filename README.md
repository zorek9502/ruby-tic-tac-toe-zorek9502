# Tic Tac Toe

## Objective
In order to practice what we have learned regarding OOP and best practices, let's implement a Tic-Tac-Toe (Gato in Spanish) game!

## Rules
- Two players represented with X and O
- First time the game is played, X startsEach player alternate turns to put a mark in the board on any available slot
- The game ends when either one of the players matches three marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row or there are no more moves available
- Once the game finishes, players are asked if they want to play again. If they do, the player who lost the previous match starts. In case of a draw, the player who did the second-to-last movement starts

## Considerations
- Will the logic have to change if I want to play on a N x N board instead of the original 3 x 3?
- Gem are supposed to be used by other programmers so they need to be well documented and tested

## Milestones

### Required
 - Create the game logic
 - Create the gem that contains that logic and verify that can be used correctly 
 - Create terminal interface
 
 ### This are not required but nice to have
  Create GUI interface (Shoes or Gosu)
  Create web app 
  Create API
##How execute the game
  -Use the following command: bundle exec ruby '.\lib\main.rb'
  -Let the game guide you.
  -Have fun!
